    <h4>Her story</h4>
    <div style="height: 3in; min-width: 3in; overflow: auto;">
      <p style="white-space: pre-line;">Under the iconic acacia trees of Kenya’s Maasai Mara, a group of Maasai women practice their ancient craft of beading, which has now become a livelihood. As proud business leaders, these women are the backbone of their communities, promoting sustainable growth and supporting their families. It has been two years since the launch of Me to We Artisans-a line of original accessories hand-crafted by women in Free The Children communities.

Today, Me to We Artisans employs over 450 women in Kenyan communities providing fair wages, up to three times more than what the women earned before. Their wages help them send their children to school, care for their families and improve their homes. The pieces are shipped to the Me to We store in Toronto, with support from logistics partner, DHL.

“The philosophy behind Me to We Artisans is the ability to forge meaningful connections between women in Kenya and women in North America through our daily purchases”, says Roxanne Joyal, founder of Me to We Artisans and co-CEO of Me to We. “And the knowledge that your purchase is empowering the hands that lovingly crafted the piece is powerful.”

Me to We Artisans has also made some powerful partnerships. Virgin Atlantic’s in-flight magazine Retail Therapy, Serena and Lily and lately, Holt Renfrew, all carry Artisans products. In addition, Artisans is worn by celebrities including Nelly Furtado, Joe Jonas, Nina Dobrev and Holly Branson. The demand for Artisans products in North America propels the success of Maasai women in Kenya. But Artisans’ inspirational cues aren’t strictly East African: the new Artisans fall collection features pieces inspired by vibrant, artisanal accessories from India.

“Artisans in India have crafted these pieces for generations, just like our mamas in the Maa-sai Mara. We’re looking to create similar opportunities in India as we have in Kenya, and support communities in achieving financial sustainability,” says Joyal.

One of this season’s must-haves is the cheery Pompom Bracelet, available in lush, bold colour combinations and made using the regal and colourful silk threads found in India. Another is the fashionably antique Anchor Friendship Bracelet, strung together on a coloured cotton cord.

This timely release of the India-inspired line also celebrates the launch of Me to We’s new centre in India. In July 2013, Me to We is launching family and corporate volunteer travel to India at its brand new Araveli Cottages. Participants on a Me to We Volunteer Adventure learn about issues that locals face, while helping a community become self-sufficient.</p>
